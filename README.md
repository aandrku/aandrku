## Hi there, I'm Andrii ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a tech enthusiast with a strong interest in building simple, useful tools â€” from web apps to command-line utilities. Iâ€™m especially drawn to operating systems and how things work under the hood.
While Iâ€™m not a full-fledged software developer (yet!), I enjoy solving real-world problems through scripting, automation, and creative tinkering.
